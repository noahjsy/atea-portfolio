            Awa Ora - Mātauranga Māori River Restoration App
          </h4>
          <p>

            A Te Ao Māori–inspired app that supports a community garden dedicated to restoring Te Taiao (the natural
            world) and revitalizing local Awa (rivers). The app empowers users to connect through mātauranga Māori
            (traditional knowledge), participate in hands-on workshops, and contribute to environmental action. Designed
            as a digital gateway to real-world impact, it helps communities learn, collaborate, and nurture both land
            and people.

      <p>  Our colour palette went through a thoughtful process initially taking on a deep pounamu green palette that would emphasise on the moss and native living organisms within local awa. The decision to shift towards hues of blue, indigo and purple arised when the green hues were creating a salt-water representation rather than fresh-water rivers.  <br> <br>

              Our final colour palette as seen above symbolises clarity, spirituality, and mystical properties of freshwater rivers. Our gradient mimics the visualisation of light shining through water, a concept in te ao māori reinforced by 'wiri' the shimmering and moving energy found in nature. </p> </div>

   <div class="process-info">

      <p>  As our research evolved, so did our design philosophy. We re-centered the project on the health of
                Aotearoa’s rivers, recognising the awa as both a living entity and a symbol of interconnected wellbeing.
                This led us to co-design a space rooted in kaitiakitanga, with a digital companion—the Awa Ora
                app—serving as a tool for citizen science and cultural reconnection. Our visual identity shifted from
                pounamu greens to a gradient of blues and purples, capturing the spiritual essence of freshwater and its
                healing qualities in Te Ao Māori. The interface was intentionally minimal, inspired by the concept of a
                taonga—a treasured object—allowing users to engage meaningfully with the river, their community, and the
                environment through the pillars of the Home, Community, and Te Taiao tabs. <br> <br></p>

         <p>Te Taiao Framework as Foundation
                We adopted the Te Taiao framework to guide design—recognising the environment, people, and culture as a
                single interconnected system. Initially we planned on breaking it down between animals, insects soil,
                water and plants. Te Taiao framework inspired us to create the app through a te ao māori lens, focusing
                on the four elements of te taiao; wai, whenua, hau and ahi. This framework ended up feeling more
                accurate and translated the information in a more meaningful way for users to digest.</p> </div>

                The app was designed to feel like a taonga, a sacred tool—minimal, intuitive, and responsive to the river’s
                health.<br> <br>

                Three Pillar Structure
                The app centres on:

                Home (real-time awa health)

                Community (local updates + events)

                Te Taiao (education through Māori environmental values) 
              
              aims to create an accessible, attractive interface for all ages, funneling interaction into memorable and user-friendly navigation, and heavy blocks of crucial information into digestable text.</p> </div>

              <h5>Design Decisions</h5>

              <p>1. Shift from “Smart” Garden to Community-Led Space
                Initial concepts focused on automation and technology. Research revealed this could harm community
                connection. We pivoted to a low-tech, people-first approach grounded in tikanga and kaitiakitanga. <br>
                <br>

                2. Focus on River Health
                Food security and pesticide issues led us to a deeper theme: the declining health of Aotearoa’s rivers.
                The project reframed the garden as a tool for restoring the mauri of the awa.<br> <br>

    

                3. Checking in with local whakairo
                I spoke with whanau from my iwi near Wairoa River to learn purakai (stories) and used patterns observed
                from my marae when working on Awa Ora.<br> <br>

                4. Colour Palette Redefined
                Originally pounamu green, we shifted to blues and purples—symbolising clarity, spirituality, and the
                life force of freshwater.<br> <br>

                5. App as a Digital Taonga
                The app was designed to feel like a sacred tool—minimal, intuitive, and responsive to the river’s
                health.<br> <br>

             



      </div>


                <div class="challenges-right">

                <h5>Challenges</h5>

                <p>One of the main challenges was navigating the balance between technological innovation and authentic
                  community engagement. Our initial direction leaned heavily on automation and emerging tech, but deeper
                  research into Aotearoa’s local communities revealed a risk: that a high-tech solution could
                  unintentionally alienate the very people we were trying to connect with. We also faced conceptual
                  challenges in defining what a “futuristic” garden meant within a Te Ao Māori context—how to honour
                  traditional knowledge systems while still responding to modern environmental concerns. Interpreting
                  and applying frameworks like Te Taiao with cultural integrity required constant consultation,
                  reflection, and adaptation. This was not a linear process, and it tested our assumptions about design,
                  sustainability, and co-creation. </p></div>
