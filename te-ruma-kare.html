      <p class="process-info">  For this brief, we were tasked with designing an interactive donation experience for Auckland Museum that engaged visitors meaningfully while reflecting the cultural values of Aotearoa. Early in our process, we made the clear and intentional decision to centre our concept around koha—the act of giving—as it felt like the most natural and culturally resonant response to the challenge. <br> <br>

Our team developed Te Ruma Karē, an immersive, garden-themed digital space inspired by Te Ao Māori principles such as manaakitanga, tikanga, and whakapapa. Visitors would step into a quiet, sacred-feeling room where they could digitally “plant” a native flower as a symbolic donation, becoming part of a growing collective display.</p>

  <p class="process-info">As UX designer and team leader, I played a key role in shaping the experience from concept to execution—including learning Blender to model the 3D space and ensure the design aligned with both practical needs and tikanga. Every detail, from the low-poly visual style to the use of poutama and purapura whetū motifs, was chosen to reflect a respectful and contemporary expression of Aotearoa and Māori culture.</p>

<p class="process-info"> Once a donation was made on the kiosk and UI seen above, visitors would then watch their selected native flower grow on the digital garden wall around them. The animation and sound draws attention to their new flower as they watch their seed sprout the flower they chose. <br><br> Another key detail is that Te Ruma Kare's background is dynamic and would rotate between night, day and the four seasons to create a sense of time within the space all year around.<br> 
    
    
    Naturally, we developed a dual palette system to highlight the physical and the metaphysical, concepts rooted in te ao māori. <br> <br>

A primary palette of soft greens and whites, inspired by the native bush, to evoke calm, clarity, and emotional connection. <br> <br>

A supporting black-based palette to represent tapu and mana, grounding the space in sacredness and enhancing contrast for visibility and impact. <br> <br>

This approach allowed us to create a visually cohesive experience that was both contemporary and culturally respectful. </p>

         <p class="process-info"> 

            Our team anchored the project in Te Ao Māori principles such as manaakitanga (hospitality), tikanga (customs), and whakapapa (connection). We envisioned the donation not as a transaction, but as a koha—a heartfelt act of giving.<br><br>
We used the metaphor of a native garden, a universally appreciated and symbolic space, to form the conceptual foundation. This metaphor shaped the emotional tone, aesthetics, and interaction model, creating a place for quiet reflection and collective contribution.

              <h5>Design Decisions</h5>
<p> We sought an identity and colour palette that embodied the calm, sacred energy of the space while remaining emotionally accessible to a global audience. Balancing aesthetic beauty with cultural integrity was essential. At the same time, we wrestled with how to ask for money—particularly from young adults in a tough economy—in a way that felt proud and unashamed.
